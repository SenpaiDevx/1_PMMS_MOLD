### Tracking Mold location 

>  - **Unique QR codes:** Assign unique QR codes to each mold, allowing easy identification throughout the manufacturing process.
>  
>   - **Strategic placement:** Embed QR codes directly onto the mold itself or on attached tags that can withstand manufacturing conditions.
>  
>   - **Scanning at checkpoints:** Integrate QR code scanners at designated stations throughout the production flow. Scanning the code upon arrival or departure from each station logs the mold's location and timestamps the event.
>  
>   - **Real-time tracking:** Utilize a central system that collects and displays scan data, providing a real-time overview of each mold's location within the facility.
>   
>- **Improved visibility:** This data can be visualized on dashboards or reports, offering clear insights into production flow, potential bottlenecks, and overall efficiency.
>

### Additional benefits
> - **Reduced errors:** Real-time location tracking minimizes misplacement or loss of molds.
> - **Enhanced traceability:** QR codes can store additional information like production date, material batch, and inspection records, facilitating traceability in case of quality issues.

> - **Streamlined communication:** Scanning QR codes can trigger automated notifications or updates to relevant personnel, improving communication and coordination.

**Integration Considerations:**

- **Choose durable QR codes:** Opt for codes resistant to heat, chemicals, and abrasion commonly encountered in mold manufacturing environments.
- **Select a compatible scanning system:** Ensure the scanners can read codes embedded on molds or tags reliably and efficiently.
- **Integrate with existing systems:** Consider integrating the QR code data with your existing manufacturing software or database for seamless information flow.
